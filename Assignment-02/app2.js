/*Practice exercise 4.1
1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.
2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console,
using the following syntax:
4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether
the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the
console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an
! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement
insteadâ€”experiment!
5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes*/

the user
4. If the input age is equal to or greater than 21, set the message variable to
confirm entry to a venue and the ability to purchase alcohol
5. If the input age is equal to or greater than 19, set the message variable to
confirm entry to the venue but deny the purchase of alcohol

none are true

/*In this exercise, we'll create a Magic 8-Ball random answer generator:
1. Start by setting a variable that gets a random value assigned to it. The value
is assigned by generating a random number 0-5, for 6 possible results. You
can increase this number as you add more results.
2. Create a prompt that can get a string value input from a user that you can
repeat back in the final output.
3. Create 6 responses using the switch statement, each assigned to a different
value from the random number generator.
4. Create a variable to hold the end response, which should be a sentence
printed for the user. You can assign different string values for each case,
assigning new values depending on the results from the random value.
5. Output the user's original question, plus the randomly selected case
response, to the console after the user enters their question*/

/*Rock Paper Scissors game
1. Create an array that contains the variables Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
2. Set up a variable that generates a random number 0-2 for the player and then
do the same for the computer's selection. The number represents the index
values in the array of the 3 items.
3. Create a variable to hold a response message to the user. This can show the
random results for the player and then also the result for the computer of the
matching item from the array.
4. Create a condition to handle the player and computer selections. If both are
the same, this results in a tie.
5. Use conditions to apply the game logic and return the correct results.
There are several ways to do this with the condition statements, but you
could check which player's index value is bigger and assign the victory
accordingly, with the exception of Rock beating Scissors.
